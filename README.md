KORG padKontrol as Cubase Controller
====================================

Tested on Cubase 9 Artist, but quite possibly will work with other Cubase
versions new and old.

Instructions
------------

- Ensure padKontrol is plugged in via USB
- Load the scene file (padkontrol-editor-librarian-scene.kpks) into
  [padKontrol Editor Librarian](https://www.korg.com/us/support/download/software/0/161/1419/)
- Configure the MIDI for Librarian software to use padKontrol MIDI2
- Click "transmit" to load the configuration onto the device
- Open Cubase and access "Device Setup"
- From "Remote Devices" click the `+` icon and add a Generic Remote
- Set the MIDI in/out to the padKontrol MIDI2 port
- Click the "Import" button and load the map file (cubase9-generic-remote.xml)

The device should be working. As an optional step, I also included an icon
map for printing onto transparency paper. The icons were sourced from Google
Images. They are not might mine nor am I responsible for your use of them.

Happy Mixing!
